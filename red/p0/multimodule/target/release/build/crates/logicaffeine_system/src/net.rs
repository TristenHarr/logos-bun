//! `Net` — the cross-target relay-backed network handle the interpreter holds.
//!
//! One API, two transports selected at compile time: native dials with the async
//! [`crate::relay::RelayClient`]; the browser dials with the callback-based
//! `crate::relay_browser::RelayBrowserClient`. Both speak the same `RelayFrame`
//! protocol to the same relay, so the interpreter's `Sync`/`Connect` lowering is
//! written once and runs on both targets. This is the platform-capability seam
//! for networking, the analogue of `get_platform_vfs()` for files.
//!
//! Events are drained, not awaited: the interpreter's `Sync` is a *sync point*
//! (publish local state, then merge whatever has arrived) — [`Net::drain`] returns
//! the pending messages without blocking, which keeps the tree-walker's linear
//! execution model intact (no background task mutating the environment).
